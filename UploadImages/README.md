# [UploadImages](./android)

This is the sample project for the **Upload images to Azure Blob Storage from an Android device** tutorial, using the Mobile Services SDK 2.0. Currently the sample available uses the Android Studio IDE.

This app is the result of completing the [Upload images to Azure Blob Storage from an Android device](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-android-upload-data-blob-storage/) tutorial. The only difference is that the downloaded version has the mobile service url and credentials filled in, whereas this version contains placeholders.

This app may be useful for you if you want to see the completed code, or want code that you can try running.
Note that to run it you must have a mobile service that is set up appropriately.
