# org.apache.cordova.console

This plugin is meant to ensure that console.log() is as useful as it can be.
It adds additional function for iOS, Ubuntu, Windows Phone 8, and Windows 8. If
you are happy with how console.log() works for you, then you probably
don't need this plugin.

This plugin defines a global `console` object.

Although the object is in the global scope, features provided by this plugin
are not available until after the `deviceready` event.

    document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
    function onDeviceReady() {
        console.log("console.log works well");
    }

## Installation

    cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.console

### Android Quirks

On some platforms other than Android, console.log() will act on multiple
arguments, such as console.log("1", "2", "3"). However, Android will act only
on the first argument. Subsequent arguments to console.log() will be ignored.
This plugin is not the cause of that, it is a limitation of Android itself.
