# Mobile Services Samples 
This GitHub repository contains the following samples that demonstrate Microsoft Azure services, including Mobile Services and Notification Hubs. 

##[GettingStarted](./GettingStarted/android)
This is the latest version of the **Get started with Mobile Services** quickstart app, using the Mobile Services SDK 2.0. Currently the sample available is for the Android platform and uses the Eclipse IDE. For more information, see the [sample readme file](./GettingStarted/readme.md).

##[GettingStartedWithData](./GettingStartedWithData/android)
This is the latest version of the **Add Mobile Services to an existing app**, using the Mobile Services SDK 2.0. Currently the sample available is for the Android platform and uses the Eclipse IDE. For more information, see the [sample readme file](./GettingStartedWithData/readme.md).

##[GettingStartedWithPush](./GettingStartedWithPush/android)
This is the latest version of the **Add push notifications to your Mobile Services app**, using the Mobile Services SDK 2.0. Currently the sample available is for the Android platform and uses the Eclipse IDE. For more information, see the [sample readme file](./GettingStartedWithPush/readme.md).

##[Table Storage With .NET Backend](./NetBackendWithTableStorage)
Samples showing how to work with a mobile service which uses Azure Table Storage to save the items in the table. It also shows how the client SDKs can be used to retrieve data from it.

##[TicTacToe](./TicTacToe)
TicTacToe is a Windows 8.1 app that uses a mobile services backend to enable multiple players to play tic-tac-toe games with each other on their Windows 8.1 devices. The sample demonstrates the same mobile service with the JavaScript and .NET backends, with the same client. The sample shows how to use table scripts (table controllers in the .NET backend), user authentication with Microsoft Accounts, push notifications using notification hubs and tags, custom APIs, and the .NET client API. See the [sample readme file](./TicTacToe/readme.md).

##[TodoListNotifications](./TodoListNotifications/readme.md) 
PhoneGap is a free and open source framework, which makes it easier to create app for key mobile device platforms using standardized web APIs, HTML and JavaScript. This sample shows how to use Azure Mobile Services (JavaScript backend) integrated with Azure Notification Hubs to send push notifications to a PhoneGap app on three client platforms: iOS, Android, and Windows Phone 8. This sample adds push notifications, using Notification Hubs, to the [PhoneGap quickstart project](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-javascript-backend-phonegap-get-started/) for Mobile Services. The sample uses the PhoneGap [PushPlugin](https://github.com/phonegap-build/PushPlugin) and Mobile Services REST APIs to create push notification registrations in the Notification Hubs. For more information, see the [sample readme file](./TodoListNotifications/readme.md).

##[TodoList as an Apache Cordova Tools for Visual Studio project](./VSCordovaTodoListQuickstart)
Mobile Services gets you started by providing a quickstart TodoList sample project for your mobile service, which you can download from the [Azure Management portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com). Sample projects are supported for most mobile device platforms, including PhoneGap. This project contains an equivalent quickstart app, but as a Cordova Tools for Visual Studio project. For more information, see the [sample readme file](./VSCordovaTodoListQuickstart/readme.md)

##[TodoOffline](./TodoOffline)
TodoOffline is a version of the todoitem quickstart updated to make use of our offline SDK features. The sample shows how to set up a local database, sync data from the server, and push changes on demand back to the server. For more information, see the [sample readme file](./TodoOffline/iOS/Readme.md)

##[Upload to Cordova apps](./CordovaUploadImages)
Shows how to use Azure Mobile Services to enable your Apache Cordova app to upload and store user-generated images in Azure Storage. This sample is an Apache Cordova Tools for Visual Studio 2013 project. The REST APIs are used to access the Blob service. For more information, see the [sample readme file](./CordovaUploadImages/readme.md).

##[Use Microsoft Azure to push notifications to Cordova apps](./CordovaNotificationsArticle)
Shows how to use Microsoft Azure with the Apache Cordova Tools for Visual Studio 2013 to enable push notifications to your Cordova apps running on iOS or Android devices. The sample supports the MSDN Magazine Article [Use Microsoft Azure to Push Notifications to Cordova Apps](http://aka.ms/yh3uh5). The Mobile Services client is used to register for template-based push notifications with Azure Notification Hubs, which is then used to send push notifications from a platform notification service (PNS) to your Cordova app running on iOS or Android. For more information, see the [sample readme file](./CordovaNotificationsArticle/readme.md).

##[Upload images to Azure Blob Storage](./UploadImages)
Shows how to use Microsoft Azure to upload images to Azure Blob Storage.  The app takes pictures with the device camera, which are then uploaded. The tutorial this code is based on is [Upload images to Azure Blob Storage from an Android device](https://acom-sandbox.azurewebsites.net/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-android-upload-data-blob-storage/). For more information, see the [sample readme file](./UploadImages/readme.md).
